# Introduction
This repository was created for the purpose of allowing the team members to work together in a simple way. The main objective is to create a CNN model that trains itself on a dataset and tries to predict the outcomes on images it has never seen before. The secondary objective is to apply filters on these images.

## Team members
@Realight02 - project manager
@ScherzoNo - cnn specialist
@ShinobuSmile - OpenCV expert

## Repository organization
The repository is organized in folders, where each has a specific goal:
CNN - contains all the files needed in order to crop images of a dataset and train the model
Dataset - contains the original dataset from Kaggle
Filters - contains the files needed in order to apply the filters on images
Prediction - contains the files needed in order to use the previously trained cnn model and predict never before seen images
Utilities - contains haar cascade files
