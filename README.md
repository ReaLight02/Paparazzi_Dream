# Introduction
This repository was created for the purpose of allowing the team members to work together in a simple way. The main objective is to create a CNN model that trains itself on a dataset and tries to predict the outcomes on images it has never seen before. The secondary objective is to apply filters on these images.

## Team members
[@Realight02(https://github.com/ReaLight02)] - project manager <br>
[@ScherzoNo](https://www.github.com/username) - cnn specialist <br>
[@ShinobuSmile](https://www.github.com/username) - OpenCV expert <br>

## Repository organization
The repository is organized in folders, where each has a specific goal: <br>
CNN - contains all the files needed in order to crop images of a dataset and train the model <br>
Dataset - contains the original dataset from Kaggle <br>
Filters - contains the files needed in order to apply the filters on images <br>
Prediction - contains the files needed in order to use the previously trained cnn model and predict never before seen images <br>
Utilities - contains haar cascade files
